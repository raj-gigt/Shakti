Error Handling
All error responses will have a JSON body with a message property describing the error.
The HTTP status code will indicate the type of error:
401 Unauthorized: Authentication or authorization error
500 Internal Server Error: Server-side error
Security
All endpoints require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
OTPs are stored in memory and expire after 5 minutes.
Notes
This API uses a Prisma client to interact with the database.
The authMiddleware function checks for a valid JWT token in the Authorization header.
The connectionId and accountType are extracted from the JWT token and used to authenticate and authorize requests.
